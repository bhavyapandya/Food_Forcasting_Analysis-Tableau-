Superstore Food Forecasting Analysis


This project aims to help a meal delivery company with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that the company's fulfilment centres can plan their stock of raw materials accordingly. The replenishment of most raw materials is done on a weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is of utmost importance. Secondly, staffing of the centres is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful.

To achieve this goal, we used three different datasets containing historical data of demand for a product-centre combination, product (meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount, and information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc.

We created a Tableau dashboard that provides a granular view of demand in each centre, including product information. The dashboard includes charts and graphs that allow the client to easily identify which fulfilment areas are doing well and which aren't. We also included centre-meal combinations to add nuance to our final submission.

By analyzing and visualizing the data, we were able to provide the client with actionable insights that can help them improve their procurement planning and staffing decisions.

To access the Tableau dashboard, please refer to the instructions provided in the project files.
